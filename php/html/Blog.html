                        The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Temple in March 2020. 
                        On 25 March 2020, Ram's idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
                        Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost and is the contractor of the project.
                         Central Building Research Institute, National Geophysical Research Institute and the 
                         Indian Institute of Technology (such as those Bombay, Guwahati, and Madras) are assisting in areas such as soil testing, concrete and design.
