        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A parish is a local church community that belongs to a larger diocese or ecclesiastical territory.
             It serves as a place of worship, community gathering, and religious education for its members.
             You are probably reading this document because your parish has
             become vacant and you need to produce a parish profile. The
             parish profile is a key part of the process of attracting a new priest
             to work with you as you seek to serve the needs of your church,
             community and the Gospel. The parish profile is the document
             on which a prospective applicant will base their decision to take
             the application further. If you are to attract the right person, then it
             needs to be an appealing document.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The concept of a parish dates back to early Christianity when communities began to form around local churches. 
            Parishes are vital in organizing religious services, education, and charity within local neighborhoods.
            When you attend Mass in the Parish Center, or even in the Historic Little Church, it is hard to imagine that St. Joseph’s Parish has its roots in the year 1856. 
            Yet, that is when this Catholic community celebrated its first Mass in a tiny log cabin just off the shores of Medicine Lake. St. Joseph’s began as a mission parish for mostly French-Canadian settlers.</p>
